2015 - 2017 I worked as interactive designer in an event production company in Colombia. My job included user experience, user interface design, coding and some other peculiar tasks related with a small company and the love you profess for you job and workgroup. However, my position and busyness card said i was the interactive designer (which i found pretty sexy), i have to accept that it wasn't the appropiate label for my position. Everytime someone asked for the interactivity's meaning i came up with an blurred idea of how we can communicate better with machines and other human beings.
