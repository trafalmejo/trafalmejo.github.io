### Space Ships?<br><br>
<div align="justify">
Small update, nothing really nice to talk about and I'm on a really bad working mood, mostly because I had to go again to my current college, which is giving me a lot of trouble. <br>
Anyway, I took a couple days (around 2) to get a Space Invaders clone going on Unity. Nothing major, but it involved basic Unity animations and managing layers.

Here are some sample screenshots and a link to the game, if anyone wants to try.

### Lessons Learned<br><br>

Having some really bad days and trying to have no 0% day at all. Some days I can work over 10 hours.. while on bad days like yesterday, I couldn't even focus for a whole 15 minutes.
