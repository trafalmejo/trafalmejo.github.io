This is a frequent question once you decided to study and work Interactivity. In Colombia, I worked with a event production company as Interactive designer, my first answer to these people interested in this new new study (because it is new and it is an art) was:
"Interactivity is communication mean which allows share information between people and machines or people and people through machines." A definition I'd read in Wikipedia if I remebered it well. However, this meaning is just a blurred offshoot of all the power of interactivity, hence, much more complex.
According with Chris Crawford in his book: The art of interactivy design, Interactivity is a process which involves the below actions: Listen, Think and Speak between two or more participants.
