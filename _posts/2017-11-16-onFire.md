With this, I've changed three times my idea. Finally, I've found something which responses to my wishes. Every idea has had a physical phenomenon involved: waves, light refraction and reflection, mirrors, fluids dynamics, inertia, etc. I realized this is not a new trend in my preferences, being that since I was a kid I encouraged myself in using practical experiments to understand concepts. Concepts => Practical uses => Interactive solutions.

OnFire studies the fire as a fluid and allow us play with its movement in a secure way. Technically speaking, I've been interested in getting out from the 3.3 - 12 volts provided by the arduino and other microcontroller boards, making bigger installations as well. Unfortunately, these wishes make everything more expensive because of quality and quantity of materials. As a first experiment with these kind of projects (talking about current and size) I will work with bulbs (domestic and cheapy elements) in order to visualize the flame's behaviour.


This elements together suggest the idea of tempeture, light and image measurement and deployment. However, the mystism and romaticism implied in the fire is huge and I dont want to screw up it. That's why the tech part should be almost invisible taking advantage of the fire's dynamic as an input. In other words I will measure the fire's intensity, direction, state, size to generate related outputs. How many interactions are we able to have with a single flame?. Let's remove the buttons, sliders, levers, handle interfaces created for the human being when there are so many organic interfaces we can take advantage of, meanwhile, we may end up amplifying their feedback.

What do I want to produce in the people?: I want them to perceive the fire from other perspectives and play around it in some other ways they, we have forgotten.
