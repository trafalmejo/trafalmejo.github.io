[One Million Dollar Home Page](http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/)
One Million Dollar Home Page is one of the first examples of adverstisement spaces in the web. His creator, Alex Tew sell spaces of 10x10 pixels in a canvas of 1000x1000. Every pixel's price was 1 dollar meaning a commercial in all the web page would cost 1 million dollar (Bigger the ad, bigger the price).
About 2416 ads are showing their products and services in the page, giving to the site a particular style of chaos and lawlessness.

- Whole idea
  -1. Get the user in our page somehow
  -2. Seduce him with a important sale
  -3. Show the product
  -4. But the product
  -5. Decide if it is needed o not.
    - If it is needed go to Amazon, best Buy o groupon + apologies because it is not gonna have the same price.
    - If it is not needed. Invitacion to throw it in our "no needed articles dump"
  -6. Invite to be partners in crime to follow and share the page
  
 - Technical requirements:
 + Feed the web with actual products (Amazon, Best Buy, etc) - Back-end code
 + Front-end showing all the Overconsumption (overwhelming) vs Minimalist economies (easy and comfortable for the eye)
 + Register and save all the data about "no needed article dump" to make our virtual garbage mountain.
 + Design rocket and launching interface (back and front end). Once we reach 15 tons we should launch it to the space.
