[One Million Dollar Home Page](http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/)
One Million Dollar Home Page is one of the first examples of adverstisement spaces in the web. His creator, Alex Tew sell spaces of 10x10 pixels in a canvas of 1000x1000. Every pixel's price was 1 dollar meaning a commercial in all the web page would cost 1 million dollar (Bigger the ad, bigger the price).
About 2416 ads are showing their products and services in the page, giving to the site a particular style of chaos and lawlessness.

- Whole idea
  -1. Get the user in our page somehow
  -2. Seduce him with a important sale
  -3. Show the product
  -4. Bui the product(Simbolically)
  -5. Decide if it is needed o not.
    - If it is needed go to Amazon, best Buy o groupon + apologies because it is not gonna have the same price.
    - If it is not needed. Invitation to throw it in our "no needed articles dump"
  -6. Invite to be partners in crime to follow and share the page
  -7. Send 15 tons of garbage to the space eventually.
  
 - Technical requirements:
 + Feed the web with actual products (Amazon, Best Buy, etc) - Back-end code
 + Front-end showing all the Overconsumption (overwhelming) vs Minimalist economies (easy and comfortable for the eye)
 + Register and save all the data about "no needed article dump" to make our virtual garbage mountain.
 + Design rocket and launching interface (back and front end). Once we reach 15 tons we should launch it to the space.

Currently I am waiting for more feedback about the idea. However, it is clear the idea is big enough to divide it by parts. In order to advance, let's define the MVP Minimun viable product.
## First stage:
Web page with fake products. Just back end design - Static pages without any kind of base data
## Second stage:
Web fed by Amazon, Best Buy's new sales. - Monitoring of weight of bought products and weight
## Third stage
Virtual garbage dump (mountain), visual launch and notifications.
