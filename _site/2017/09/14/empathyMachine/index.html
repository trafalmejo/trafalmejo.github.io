      <p>What should we consider doing a empathy machine?. First at all, lets define empathy as the capability of understand or feel someonelse’s feelings. Some sort of machine with this functionality would be extraodinary desirable, since the main goal of every mean of communication is to send and receive messages through emiters and receptors, what could be more effective than communicate messages connected with feelings?, a new level of effective messages. For sure, everybody will work better together if we feel in the same way about several topics. I am talking about less verbal communication, less doubt about coexistence, more effectiveness, more tolerance and why not, world peace!.</p>

<p>Suppose we’ve already had the empathy machine. What do we want to share with other human being? We cannot simply divide the emotions that we feel in specific moments, it is too much more complicated than that. Every life event is composed by different emotions which raise or fall down according with several internal and external factors. Anyway, if we decided to communicate emotions and feelings the normal way to do it would be communicating more than one, in that order of ideas we would be communicating states (all the feelings presented in one life event).</p>

<p>That said, let’s use the most popular expression to make the exchange: “You just need to put yourself in someone else’s shoes”. Every time you use my shoe you will be able to access the life events i’ve chosen (maybe i dont want to share all my lifetime with someone else).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/empathyMachine.jpeg" alt="empathyMachine" /></p>

<p>In this quick sketch there are some life events which worth it.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Being in jail</li>
  <li>Deliver a baby</li>
  <li>Get Married</li>
  <li>Lose your pet</li>
  <li>Attend ITP</li>
  <li>Lose yourself</li>
  <li>Graduation</li>
  <li>Being in war.</li>
</ol>

<p>Just thing how difficult is to explain those life events to someone else, but how valuable would be if you do it correctly.</p>

<p>So what about if i wanna record some memorable moments, but we are not talking about photos, audio, videos of any of that. Let’s record how you felt. You put the shoe and it connects to you somehow in an Sfi mode (many things started that way). You choose your memory hole/slot and to start recording you kick the other foot slightly. You will stop recording in the same way.</p>

<p>Our shoe will have a lifetime experience by hole and the way you decide to connect the laces and the holes will determine the storyline of the sotry you wanna communicate. On the other hand, the receptor is able to put the show and control the playback of the feelings. Does he wanna go back o go forward? It is up to him/her. Anyway, some experiences could be insufferable for some people and that’s why you can loose the tie in case of pain threshold.</p>
