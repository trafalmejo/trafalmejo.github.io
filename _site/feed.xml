  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Project working title&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;+NoNeeded articles dump&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tweet-length project description&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;NoNeeded articles dump is a virtual dump with trendy products which people decided not to buy because they realized they actually don’t need them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Paragraph-length project description&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Buy and sell stuff is the base of our economy. Unfortunately, it implies meanwhile our population is increasing, our goods production rates are rising up as well, speeding up non recyclable garbage generation. This concern get worse due to people who buy articles they actually don’t need driven by sales, low prices, commercials and trends. 
 Minimal economies promotes the trade of reusable goods as experiences, art, services, travel and tourism and even high quality products with longer life expectancies. Long term consequences will include less consumption, less production of goods and therefore less earnings rates in exchange of a more sustainable system. NoNeeded articles dump is a virtual dump with trendy products people decided not to buy because they realized they don’t need them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;concept&quot;&gt;Concept&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What basic reality does your project reflect?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Unbelievable sales!. The lowest prices just available on black fridays.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What basic reality does your project mask or pervert?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Those trendy articles don’t have that sort of discounts (YET)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Does your project mask the absence of a basic reality?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;No, this project make this current reality stronger and more desirable in order to honey pot compulsive buyers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Does your project bear relation to any reality whatsoever?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;No, It is a feasible reality anytime.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;intent&quot;&gt;Intent&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tools used, with justification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Node.js - web Crawling (optional) in order to get actual sales and make it more desirable&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Node.js - backend framework (optional) in order to register numbers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Express.js - frontend framework - to generate dinamic content&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Photoshop - content development look and feel minimal  vs overconsumption&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Godaddy hosting and Buy Domain&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Promote sharing via facebook - promote partners in crime who recomend the sales.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data collection and measurement (if appropriate)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Node.js + web storage = noNeeded articles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ethical risks and mitigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;people who are not interested in the project - apologies and explanation of the project.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;people’s feelings hurt - apologies and explanation of the project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Legal risks and mitigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;commercial web page - no credit card or personal information trade&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;official web pages demands - not a copy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;justification&quot;&gt;Justification&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why are you interested/excited/compelled to pursue this project?
Dollar tree prices and quality products. Black fridays madness and garages full of garbage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;links&quot;&gt;Links&lt;/h2&gt;

        <title>Grab a thing</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/o09.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Interactivity&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I choose really a simply machine to analize. Electronic claw arcade game also known as claw crane. This machine invite people to play with it. Once the coin is inside of it, you have 30 seconds to grab one of the items shown in the showcase with the help of a mechanical claw. If you win you will get a “valuable” object otherwise you will just lose your money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The components of this arcade are: clear case, time display, button to grab, joystick, claw in a XY car and awards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/o10.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Interactivity&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clear cubed case allows users to get a notion of spaciality and use the joystick in order to move the car and the claw to any desire point in the highest plane of the case. Once the user decided it is the correct location, he/she press the button which triggers the claw to get down and close. The claw is always gonna return to its initial position and then open. If you grab something you will have it through a dispenser in the lower part of the machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users tend to see the position of the objects and the claw on the X and Z axes (ground axes) in order to align them and get better chances. Besides, it is really common to try first with the higher objects, which are closer and more free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/o01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Interactivity&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to point this sort of machines are well known worldwide which means the learning curve in every play is short no matter how different the design is. However, every configuration differs from each other, which can be make the task easier or not. In order to grab anything there are many variables to consider information about several features from position, weight to torque which this machine is not giving out. This could be seen as an example of a machine that gives a really little feedback to its users which is the whole idea. Let’s imagine a claw crane with extraodinary feedback capabilities. In that case, this machine would deliver information about the position, claw strength and aperture, the motion speed, the pick up strength, object’s size, weight and so on. This task would be as intuitive as grab something with our bare hands, which means everyone will win in a game without difficulty level. Bad deal!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This machine has low interactivity on purpose to challenge their users in order to get money. Almost as a Casino where the variables are many and the users feel more lucky than the faith. Win in those cases is possible, but really difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>White Balance and Exposure exercise</title>
        <description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;white-balance&quot;&gt;White Balance&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Auto White Balance
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/whiteBalanceAuto.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Auto White Balance&quot; /&gt;
Grey Card White Balance
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/whiteBalanceGreyCard.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Grey Card White Balance&quot; /&gt;
This excercise shows the unaccurate color taken by auto white balance feature in the Canon Mark III camera. The auto white balance feature averages the color pixels present in the scene, this produces a predominant color in the image similar to a color filter which alterates the actual color. In order to correct this, we’ve used 50% grey card to set up the white balance correctly. You can find this feature as a Custom white balance correction.
This particular photos were taking indoor. The auto white balance give us a yellowish image meanwhile the grey card set up shows us balanced colors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;exposure&quot;&gt;Exposure&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/exposure01.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Exposure 01&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/exposure02.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Exposure 02&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/exposure03.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Exposure 03&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A right exposure is mandatory in order not to lose data. A histogram visualization show us the color distribution in the image, therefore, histogram values goes from 0 (Black) and 255 (White). That said, it is not desirable to use 0 and 255 values and avoid pure whites and blacks. Above images and its histograms show us good exposure examples.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Reflection of a basic reality</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Actual media is full of trend contents which reach more people every time, because social media is widespread. Fake or not fake media, this postulates drive people’, industries’, economies’ behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overconsumption, over population, global warming have been trend news in the last 15 years, which means so much people have interested in the subject, making them better businesses. Green products, green policies and green infraestructures have become more desirable for consumers who make them a revelant topic. 
However, this new profitable and green industry don’t attack the core fact that we consume so much more than we need, instead of that it promotes buying “green” shoes made from organic materials, which fabrication proccesses used water, fuels and implied other sort of waste.
This green wave should be realigned in order to communicate how we shouldn’t consume ecofriend stuff, instead of that we have to consume less, just because we just dont need that much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main goal of this project is not to boost green products’ profits, hence companies’. The goal is make people realice of their basic needs and someonelse’s in order not to waste material, time, people and that way promotes a much more efficient resources cycle. There are tons of reusable material between our stuff, many of it remains in our garage and atics. More reusable material is in the ocean trapped in ocean currents, meanwhile some other is underground in garbage dumps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those capitalism lovers who are thinking how our economy is based in trading and this minimalism would attend with our entire status quo, I have to tell you are right. However, it is about consume less physical products and turn all that money flow in other untangible way of trading. Paying for experiences, travel, tourism, art, services and even high quality products will decrease trash considerably. The economy would consume less, earn less and produce less in order to mantain promote a healthier, sustainable system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Big_Piece_of_Garbage&quot;&gt;A big piece of garbage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big piece of garbage is a Futurama’s chapter released in 1999. Its fictional premise is that earth’s garbage cannot longer remain in the planet. That’s why humanity decides to eject all the garbage toward the space. Unfortunately, the giant ball of gargabe returned to the earth, threating life in earth. This satire is based on Khian Sea waste disposal incident, in which more than 14.000 tons of ash from waste were travelling around 2 years because no country was interested in accept it. Sadly, the ship’s captain admitted that they had dumped the most of it into the Atlantic ocean, causing biological and political consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khian_Sea_waste_disposal_incident&quot;&gt;Khian Sea waste disposal incident&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another fictional example no far from reality, just in other scale and possible future. The reality I want to reflect is one where people are buying stuff they don’t need and more important are willing to buy more and more without even thinking about it. There are enough audiovisual and paper material to settle down this precedent and let people feel identified with their reality. Let’s fake the fact of a possible event with huge quantities of accumulated garbage. What are you able to do with someonelse garbage? A giant garbage monster terrifying towns near ocean, garbage paradise islands, ocean currents of second-hand stuff to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve though about the opposite idea. What about create a mountain of articles we are interested in but we didn’t buy it because we realized we don’t need them. A Virtual mountain of no needed articles. How do I make people lose their desire of acquisition?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;1. Analize the user preferences and behaviours
2. Suggest the user a special article which is on sale coincidentally
3. Allow the user to buy the article (simbollically)
4. Expose why the user don't need the object, indeed.
5. Invite the user to throw their no needed articles.
.
.
.
.
6. Sent the no needed garbage to the space.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I consider very difficult to categorized my intention as a lie, hoax, satire, rumor or conspirancy at this point because the idea is making me think about multiples ways to accomplish it. My approach to the solution will be virtual off course, taking advantage of all the tools to customer tracking  already available in the market. It is my interest to get people’ attention in a page full of sales where they can buy what they dont need. The skills I will require are web design and web development in order to fake and register all the no needed articles. However, the most important part is to reach people all around to make them partners in crime once the experience ended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lets-sale-shit&quot;&gt;Let’s sale shit.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/&quot;&gt;One Million Dollar Home Page&lt;/a&gt;
One Million Dollar Home Page is one of the first examples of adverstisement spaces in the web. His creator, Alex Tew sell spaces of 10x10 pixels in a canvas of 1000x1000. Every pixel’s price was 1 dollar meaning a commercial in all the web page would cost 1 million dollar (Bigger the ad, bigger the price).
About 2416 ads are showing their products and services in the page, giving to the site a particular style of chaos and lawlessness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;General sketches&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/fakingIdea.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;General Sketches&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whole-idea&quot;&gt;Whole idea&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get the user in our page somehow&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Seduce him with a important sale&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Show the product&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bui the product(Simbolically)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Decide if it is needed o not.
    + If it is needed go to Amazon, best Buy o groupon + apologies because it is not gonna have the same price.
    + If it is not needed. Invitation to throw it in our “no needed articles dump”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Invite to be partners in crime to follow and share the page&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Send 15 tons of garbage to the space eventually.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;technical-requirements&quot;&gt;Technical requirements:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Feed the web with actual products (Amazon, Best Buy, etc) - Back-end code&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Front-end showing all the Overconsumption (overwhelming) vs Minimalist economies (easy and comfortable for the eye)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Register and save all the data about “no needed article dump” to make our virtual garbage mountain.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Design rocket and launching interface (back and front end). Once we reach 15 tons we should launch it to the space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/fakingStyle.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;General Sketches&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently I am waiting for more feedback about the idea. However, it is clear the idea is big enough to divide it by parts. In order to advance, let’s define the MVP Minimun viable product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;first-stage&quot;&gt;First stage:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web page with fake products. Just back end design - Static pages without any kind of base data&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;second-stage&quot;&gt;Second stage:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web fed by Amazon, Best Buy’s new sales. - Monitoring of weight of bought products and weight&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;third-stage&quot;&gt;Third stage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virtual garbage dump (mountain), visual launch and notifications.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What is Interactivity?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a frequent question once you decided to study and work around Interactivity. In Colombia, I worked with an event production company as Interactive designer, my first answer to these people interested in this new study (because it is new) was:
“Interactivity is communication mean which allows share information between people and machines or people and people through machines.” A definition I’d read in Wikipedia if I remembered it well. However, this meaning is just a blurred offshoot of all the power of interactivity.
Reading Chris Crawford and his book: The Art of Interactivy Design, Interactivity is a process which involves the below actions: 
Listen, Think and Speak between two or more participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/interactivity01.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Interactivity&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every participant should be able to do these three basic actions in orden to communicate. Definitely it is more complex idea than I used to explain. That said, Interactivity is a tool which promotes more efective communication focusing in quality of inputs, processes and outputs of several systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/interactivity02.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Interactivity&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every individual action is a critical process itself and according with its fluency and rhythm, the communication will success. That said, the interactivity should be categorized by levels defined by how armonical are all their processes between them. Not all the systems are balanced, making low and high levels of interactivity. Remembering Crawford once more time, imagine two people who are communicating between each other. Every participant should be able to listen very well in orden to get 100% of the information, no data lost. At the same time every part have to be able to analize te information in similar paces. No one wants to talk too fast or too slow. Finally, consider how the way we speak defines the quality of the data we transmit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking an example from Bred Victor, the possible futures of touchable displays which are showed in this prommotional video is just insufficient to explain all the feasible features available in an interactivity future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;865&quot; height=&quot;486&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/nOU_t4bqEJg&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this video there is just an improvement in the UI/UX, meanwhile the info and experience approach are the same. In the future we dream, the objects will have more tools to communicate data, more ways to feedback their users and hence, more efficient manners of speaking, listening and proccesing. We are talking about textures, balance, movements, taste, smell, sensations, weight, body’s parts we are able to take advantage of, but we dont (we are just touching glass). That’s not the future I imagine neither.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the interactivity as a communicational medium, we should ask ourselves what is the core of their existence?, so far it is just another form of communication, but why should it be more desirable?. The answer is the competitive advantage implicits in the interactivity. High levels of interactivity promotes ENGAGEMENT. Consider the practical uses of a communicational mean in which people spend more time. Children could learn faster and deeper. Adults could become more empathic. Elders could catch up new tecnologies and decrease the generational gap. Even evil propaganda should be more effective with this kind of engagement tools. Just try to use interactivity for the common good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/layer.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Interactivity&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, any notion of interactivity has been designed based on human capabilities, but let’s think about how much are we able to read or sense?, how quick do we process information?. Probably you’ve already notice how many tasks could be done for a computer at the same time and how fast it deliveres it. This fact builds up a whole usability layer that transform data in order people to read it. A layer designed because our limitations. We’ve started becoming the asymptote which makes us think about tools to improve interactivity, tools used on ourselves to get better beings. Tools of the future.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Empathy machine</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;What should we consider doing a empathy machine?. First at all, lets define empathy as the capability of understand or feel someonelse’s feelings. Some sort of machine with this functionality would be extraodinary desirable, since the main goal of every mean of communication is to send and receive messages through emiters and receptors, what could be more effective than communicate messages connected with feelings?, a new level of effective messages. For sure, everybody will work better together if we feel in the same way about several topics. I am talking about less verbal communication, less doubt about coexistence, more effectiveness, more tolerance and why not, world peace!.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose we’ve already had the empathy machine. What do we want to share with other human being? We cannot simply divide the emotions that we feel in specific moments, it is too much more complicated than that. Every life event is composed by different emotions which raise or fall down according with several internal and external factors. Anyway, if we decided to communicate emotions and feelings the normal way to do it would be communicating more than one, in that order of ideas we would be communicating states (all the feelings presented in one life event).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, let’s use the most popular expression to make the exchange: “You just need to put yourself in someone else’s shoes”. Every time you use my shoe you will be able to access the life events i’ve chosen (maybe i dont want to share all my lifetime with someone else).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/empathyMachine.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;empathyMachine&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this quick sketch there are some life events which worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Being in jail&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deliver a baby&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get Married&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lose your pet&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Attend ITP&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lose yourself&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Graduation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Being in war.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just thing how difficult is to explain those life events to someone else, but how valuable would be if you do it correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what about if i wanna record some memorable moments, but we are not talking about photos, audio, videos of any of that. Let’s record how you felt. You put the shoe and it connects to you somehow in an Sfi mode (many things started that way). You choose your memory hole/slot and to start recording you kick the other foot slightly. You will stop recording in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our shoe will have a lifetime experience by hole and the way you decide to connect the laces and the holes will determine the storyline of the sotry you wanna communicate. On the other hand, the receptor is able to put the show and control the playback of the feelings. Does he wanna go back o go forward? It is up to him/her. Anyway, some experiences could be insufferable for some people and that’s why you can loose the tie in case of pain threshold.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What do you want to fake?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Baudrillard’s “procession of the simulacra” narrows down the thin line between true/false and real/imaginary. The first question is: Why do we want to fake facts? What is the goal behind masking the reality?. Once it is solved the following concern is: How can we fake the real world to create opinions based on rhetoric, audiovisuals and cultural bubbles?.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would I do it? As a first experimental exercise i am interested in day by day user experience. I want to know how much people are willing to believe in facts almost fictional. This thought remind me: Google Nose BETA, an April fools’ day prank made by Google on 2013 and how much people were amazed and convince about such tech advances, getting close to theirs laptop in order to catch digital smell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbYadm_mrw&quot;&gt;Google Nose BETA (2013)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;865&quot; height=&quot;486&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/VFbYadm_mrw&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.google.com/tisp/index.html&quot;&gt;Google TiSP (2011)&lt;/a&gt;: It promotes free internet using your local municipal sewage lines. You can installed yourself (DIY). Gloves provided&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=72&amp;amp;v=Bu927_ul_X0&quot;&gt;Gmail Motion (2011)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;865&quot; height=&quot;486&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bu927_ul_X0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This last fake product allows you control any gmail feature via gestures. Tracking your movements  through the laptop’s camera you were able interact in other ways without using mouse or keyboard. If you ask me, not far away from current technologies such as Microsoft Kinect or LeapMotion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In spite of Google has made this sort of pranks long time ago. Users are still being cheated, filling Google customer service of mails aabouts these events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But those kind of products are not just a result of pranks. Some of them are sold and bought all the time between us as fake products. Products which cheat consumers selling false benefits. I am talking about products and services from shake weights, weight loss pills, weight loss wraps to false data recovery web sites and false investments with high revenues, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the same vein of thought, I’d been seduced by the idea of create a fictional product in which people believe in, maybe invest in, and someday remind them how vulnerable we are to all these social media, needs, culture bubbles and fake commercials. That said, we will make people ask themselves: What is this product exactly?, Are its features accurate? Do I need it?&lt;/p&gt;
